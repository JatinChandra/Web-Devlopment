# Web-Devlopment

This is simple WebD project created to learn HTML, CSS and other basic WebD languages.

This web development project focuses on creating a login and sign-up page for a website. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a secure and user-friendly authentication system. The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating the front-end interface, while PHP and MySQL are used for the back-end implementation of the authentication system.

The login page allows users to enter their username and password, which are then verified against the database. If the credentials are correct, the user is redirected to the main page of the website. If the credentials are incorrect, the user is prompted to try again or reset their password (Password reset feature is not yet introduce).

The sign-up page allows new users to create an account by entering their name, address, username, and password and etc. The system then verifies that the username and are not already in use and adds the new user to the database. Once the account is created, the user can log in and access the website.

To ensure security, the passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the database.

Overall, this project aims to provide a secure and reliable authentication system for a website, making it easy for users to sign up and log-in while protecting their personal information.

All the files are ziped and already uploaded which you can use it.
